# Apex1
Apex Congestion Control
This is a Network reinforced machine learning.
in one file called apex22
and A congestion control named apex.c

My goal is to combine both elements to
control the network setting in the machine
and to do congestion control.

My final version if possible will
combine both aspects into one working
linux Kernal version for linux and beyond.

I want reinforced machine learning because
it's adaptive and not just some simple
algorithm sitting in the background.

if you would like to contribute or help make this 
possible,bu all means "Fork It"
don't forget to include my name in it.
